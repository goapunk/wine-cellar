## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure your machine has the following installed:

- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (for the backend)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the Wine Cellar app:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine and navigate into the project folder:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wine-cellar.git
cd wine-cellar
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

This command will set up a Python virtual environment, install Python dependencies, install npm packages, build the frontend, and apply database migrations:

```sh
make install
```

### 3. Run the Development Server

To start the Django development server, use:

```sh
make server
```

By default, the server will run at `http://127.0.0.1:8003/`.

### 4. Watch for Changes

To automatically rebuild the frontend and restart the backend server on file changes, run:

```sh
make watch
```

### 5. Create a User

Create an admin user for managing the app by running the following:

```sh
source venv/bin/activate
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### 6. Load Fixtures (Optional)

If you want to load some initial data (e.g., sample wines, categories), run:

```sh
make fixtures
```

## Directory Structure

Here's an overview of the project structure:

- `wine_cellar/`: Main application code (Django app for wines, inventory, ratings, etc.).
- `tests/`: Test cases for the application (both backend and frontend).
- `node_modules/`: Directory for npm packages (installed dependencies for the frontend).
- `venv/`: Python virtual environment (isolated dependencies for the backend).
- `Makefile`: A file containing predefined commands for setup and running the app.

---

## Running Tests

To run the full test suite (both Django and frontend tests), use:

```sh
make test
```

You can also run Django backend tests directly using:

```sh
python manage.py test
```
